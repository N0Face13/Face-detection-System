# Face Mask Detection and Worker Task Scheduler 
●	Created a streamlit application which detects in real time whether a user is wearing a face mask correctly/incorrectly or not wearing at all. On detecting the mask worn correctly the system displayed a daily schedule for the user.
●	Trained a model on 10000+ photographs and went over 20 epochs to improve the accuracy of the model. The model used Convolutional Neural Networks for training and helping in detection of faces.
●	Post training the model had an accuracy of 87-95% in normally lit conditions and 92-97% in well-lit conditions.
●	Task scheduling was linked to an SQL database and integrated with face detection, designed for labs and environments requiring face masks, inspired by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Technologies used: Python, Tensorflow, Streamlit(Python lib), SQL, CV2(Mobile sized CNN)
